##RestaurantPOS

This is a web based application for a restaurant POS system implemented using JSP, bootstrap, and jQuery. It provides customers the ability to create new orders by adding items from the menu. The user is able to filter the dishes from the menu by selecting ingredients that they wish to have and the dishes will be filtered out using AJAX. There is a backend UI for the managers/chefs/waiters to use in order to create new dishes, new ingredients and update orders.
